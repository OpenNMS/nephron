== Run on Flink
Once you have set up your Flink cluster and sized it to your flows volume, run the following to run Nephron on Flink:

`./bin/flink run --parallelism 1 --class org.opennms.nephron.Nephron /root/git/nephron/assemblies/flink/target/nephron-flink-bundled-*.jar --runner=FlinkRunner --jobName=nephron --checkpointingInterval=600000 --autoCommit=false`

After Nephron set up, you must do the following:

 * xref:operation:flows/nephron/kafka.adoc#kafka-config[Configure Kafka]
 * xref:operation:flows/nephron/persistence.adoc#nephron-persistence[Configure persistence]
 * xref:operation:flows/nephron/monitor.adoc#nephron-monitor[Monitor Nephron]
