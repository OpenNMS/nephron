* Sentinel added to your flows environment (see *Operation>Flow Support>Scale Flow Processing with Sentinel* in the core docs)
* link:https://flink.apache.org/[Apache Flink] {compatible-flink} cluster set up and sized to your flows volume

[[flink]]
== Run on Flink
Once you set up your Flink cluster and size it to your flows volume, run the following to set up Nephron on Flink:

`./bin/flink run --parallelism 1 --class org.opennms.nephron.Nephron /root/git/nephron/assemblies/flink/target/nephron-flink-bundled-*.jar --runner=FlinkRunner --jobName=nephron --checkpointingInterval=600000 --autoCommit=false`

After Nephron set up, you must do the following:

 * xref:kafka.adoc#kafka-config[Configure Kafka]
 * xref:persistence.adoc#nephron-persistence[Configure persistence]
 * xref:monitor.adoc#nephron-monitor[Monitor Nephron]
